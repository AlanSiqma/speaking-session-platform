# ADR-0001 — Architectural Foundation and C4 Overview

* **Status:** Accepted
* **Date:** 2026-02-06
* **Decision Makers:** Architecture Owner
* **Context:** Speaking Session Platform

---

# 1. Context

The **Speaking Session Platform** is an AI‑assisted speaking practice system designed to support:

* Structured speaking sessions
* Audio recording and transcription
* AI‑driven evaluation and feedback
* Persistent learning history and progress tracking

The system must balance two competing forces:

1. **Production‑grade architectural quality** expected from Staff‑level engineering
2. **Pragmatic simplicity** required for a single‑developer, early‑stage SaaS

To guide long‑term evolution while avoiding premature complexity, the
architecture is defined through a **C4 Container‑level model** that acts as the
**foundational architectural decision** for the platform.

All subsequent architectural decisions derive from this model and are
versioned as **ADR‑0001A, ADR‑0001B, ADR‑0001C, ...**

# 2. Decision

## 2.1 Establish the C4 container architecture as the system foundation

The platform architecture is formally defined by the **C4 Container diagram**,
which describes:

* Frontend application
* Backend‑for‑Frontend (BFF) responsible for session orchestration
* Asynchronous Speech‑to‑Text processing pipeline
* AI evaluation through an LLM Anti‑Corruption Layer (ACL)
* Context and transactional data storage separation
* Observability as a transversal capability

This diagram represents the **authoritative architectural boundary** for the
system at its current maturity level.

---

## 2.2 Treat ADR‑0001 as the root architectural decision

ADR‑0001 is not a single isolated decision, but rather the
**architectural foundation** composed of:

* **ADR‑0001A — Asynchronous STT processing**
* **ADR‑0001B — BFF domain orchestration strategy**
* **ADR‑0001C — LLM integration boundary via ACL**

Each sub‑ADR refines a specific concern while remaining
**structurally bound to the same C4 architecture**.

No sub‑ADR may contradict the C4 model without:

* Updating this root ADR
* Versioning the architectural foundation

---

## 2.3 Define evolutionary architecture as a core principle

The architecture is intentionally designed to be:

* **Simple today**
* **Extractable tomorrow**
* **Scalable when required**

Key strategies include:

* Asynchrony only where latency and failure justify it
* Logical domain boundaries before physical service extraction
* Isolation of external AI providers through ACL
* Observability embedded from the beginning

This approach follows **evolutionary architecture** practices aligned with
Staff‑level engineering.

# 3. Consequences

## 3.1 Positive

* Clear architectural source of truth via C4
* Consistent evolution through versioned sub‑ADRs
* Avoidance of premature microservice complexity
* Strong alignment with real‑world SaaS architecture patterns

## 3.2 Trade‑offs

* Some responsibilities remain centralized in the BFF
* Future refactoring will be required as domain complexity grows
* Architectural discipline is required to maintain coherence with C4

These trade‑offs are **explicitly accepted**.

---

# 4. Alternatives Considered

## 4.1 Independent ADRs without a root architectural decision — Rejected

Rejected because it would:

* Fragment architectural reasoning
* Reduce traceability between decisions
* Allow silent architectural drift

---

## 4.2 Premature microservice decomposition — Rejected

Rejected due to:

* Operational overhead
* Lack of real scaling pressure
* Increased cognitive complexity

The system instead follows **progressive extraction guided by domain growth**.

---

# 5. Architectural Principles Established

ADR‑0001 defines the foundational principles of the platform:

* **C4 as the architectural source of truth**
* **Evolutionary architecture over premature distribution**
* **Explicit domain lifecycle ownership**
* **Isolation of external AI dependencies**
* **Operational observability from day one**

These principles characterize **Staff‑level architectural governance**.

---

# 6. Relationship to Future ADRs

All future architectural ADRs must:

* Reference ADR‑0001
* Remain consistent with the C4 model
* Declare when they introduce architectural evolution

If a future decision **changes the container architecture**, it must:

1. Create **ADR‑0001‑v2**
2. Provide migration rationale
3. Preserve historical traceability

---

# 7. Next Steps

* Maintain the C4 diagram as the authoritative architectural artifact
* Implement sub‑ADR decisions in code and infrastructure
* Introduce observability and deployment pipelines aligned with this model
* Reassess architectural boundaries as real usage grows
